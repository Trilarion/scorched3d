	<p> Scorched 3D is a game based loosely (or actually quite heavily now) on the classic DOS game Scorched Earth 
	&quot;The Mother Of All Games&quot;.  Scorched 3D adds
        amongst other new features a 3D island environment and LAN and internet play.
Scorched 3D is totally free and is available for both Microsoft Windows and
Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris etc.) operating systems.

You can pick up the game and begin playing very quickly.  Then, when/if you are interested, 
you can poke in the dimmer recesses of the game and get into the strategy (or just ignore 
it altogether!).
</p>

<p>
At its lowest level, Scorched 3D is just an artillery game with two+ tanks
taking turns to destroy opponents in an arena.  Choose the angle, direction 
and power of each shot, launch your weapon, and try to blow up other 
tanks. That's basically it. 
</p>

<p>
But Scorched 3D can be a lot more complex than that, if you want it to be. 
You can earn money from successful battles and use it to invest in additional weapons 
and accessories. You can play with up to twenty four other players at a time, mixing 
computer players with humans. There's a variety of changing environmental 
conditions and terrains to be dealt with. 
After the end of each round (which ends when everybody dies or there's only one person left), 
you get to buy stuff using the prize money you won from previous matches.
