		<p><b>Overview</b><br>
			Scorched 3D is a game based loosely (or actually quite heavily now) on the 
			classic DOS game Scorched Earth &quot;The Mother Of All Games&quot;. Scorched 
			3D adds amongst other new features a 3D island environment and LAN and internet 
			play. Scorched 3D is totally free and is available for both Microsoft Windows 
			and Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris etc.) operating systems.

			You can pick up the game and begin playing very quickly. Then, when/if you are 
			interested, you can poke in the dimmer recesses of the game and get into the 
			strategy (or just ignore it altogether!).
		</p>
		<p>
			At its lowest level, Scorched 3D is just an artillery game with two+ tanks 
			taking turns to destroy opponents in an arena. Choose the angle, direction and 
			power of each shot, launch your weapon, and try to blow up other tanks. That's 
			basically it.
		</p>
		<p>
			But Scorched 3D can be a lot more complex than that, if you want it to be. You 
			can earn money from successful battles and use it to invest in additional 
			weapons and accessories. You can play with up to twenty four other players at a 
			time, mixing computer players with humans. There's a variety of changing 
			environmental conditions and terrains to be dealt with. After the end of each 
			round (which ends when everybody dies or there's only one person left), you get 
			to buy stuff using the prize money you won from previous matches.
