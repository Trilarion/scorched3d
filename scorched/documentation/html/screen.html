<b>Screen Layout</b><br>
<p><img src=screenshots/quickstart5.jpg></p>
<p>
Scorched3D has a basic screen layout shown above.  The screen consists of the main playing area
with a few dialogs 
<img src=numbers/number-1.jpg> <img src=numbers/number-2.jpg> 
<img src=numbers/number-3.jpg> <img src=numbers/number-4.jpg>.
Each dialog can be moved by dragging.  Some can also be resized by dragging the bottom right corner.
</p>

<b>Wind Dialog</b><br>
<p><img src=screenshots/wind.jpg></p>
<p>
The wind dialog gives the current information about the wind speed and direction.  
Every shot made is affected by the current wind conditions.  The shot power and 
angle may need to be adjusted to take the wind into account.<br>
<img src=numbers/number-5.jpg> The wind direction is shown as an arrow.<br>
<img src=numbers/number-6.jpg> The wind strength is shown as words.<br>
<img src=numbers/number-7.jpg> The island.<br>
The wind view moves so that the wind direction arrow is always correct with respect to 
the current camera angle.  The direction arrow is therefor relative to the
current camera view not the plan view.
</p>

<b>Plan View Dialog</b><br>
<p><img src=screenshots/plan.jpg></p>
<p>
The plan view dialog shows the island from a top down view (looking directly down from the top)
<img src=numbers/number-5.jpg>.
All of the player positions are shown as coloured dots.  Each dot is colored the same
color of the player it represents.  
The dots representing player(s) still making their move will flash on and off.
The current player is shown by a ring around their dot <img src=numbers/number-6.jpg>.
Tool tips describing each player are available by moving the mouse over each dot.
</p>
<p>
The current camera position is shown on the plan view as a wedge <img src=numbers/number-7.jpg>.
The camera can be positioned to look at any point on the landscape by clicking on the plan view.
The camera will be moved to look at the clicked point on the landscape.
</p>

will go dark with a lighter area around your tank.  This lighter area is
the area to where the tank can move.  To move the tank left click within
the light area.  The tank cannot move up very steep hills so you may not be
able to move out of or across craters.
