		<br>
		<b>Joining an Online Game</b><br>
		<p>
			Scorched3D can be played online either over the internet or a LAN. Server 
			browsing is now (as of version 36) integrated directly into the Scorched3D main 
			application. To play online:-<br>
			<img src="screenshots/online1.gif"><img src="screenshots/online2.gif"><br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Start Scorched3D and choose "Internet/LAN" from the main menu dialog <img src="numbers/number-1.gif">.
				<li>
					This will show the Scorched3D server browsing dialog. Refresh the list of 
					scorched servers clicking on the refresh button <img src="numbers/number-2.gif">.
				<li>
					The server list should now have the list of available servers in it. Choose the 
					server you wish to join by clicking on the appropriate server name in the 
					server list <img src="numbers/number-3.gif">. Depending on how many people 
				are on the server and the version of the server you may be unabled to join.
				<li>
					Click the join server button <img src="numbers/number-4.gif">.
			</ol>
		</p>
		<b>Starting A Scorched3D Server</b><br>
		<p>
			To start a Scorched3D server:-
			<br>
			<img src="screenshots/server1.gif"><img src="screenshots/server2.gif"><br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Start Scorched3D and choose "Server" from the main menu dialog <img src="numbers/number-1.gif">.
				<li>
					Choose any server options <img src="numbers/number-2.gif"> and any game options <img src="numbers/number-3.gif">
					you want the server to have.
					<br>
				NOTE: The Scorched3D server browsing code will try to automatically determine 
				the IP address of the server. If the server is behind a NAT or web proxy this 
				may fail. In this case it may be necessary to specify the server IP address in 
				the box provided on the server settings page.
				<li>
					Start the server <img src="numbers/number-4.gif">.
			</ol>
			Once the server is running server conectivity can be checked by going to the 
			Scorched3D homepage (http://www.scorched3d.co.uk) and choosing the servers tab. 
			If you can see your server, and all its details, on this page then it is a good 
			bet that other people will be able to connect. If you cannot see you server on 
			this page then you may need to manually enter your ip address (see step 2 
			above) or open/forward some ports on you machine (see <a href="ports.html">here</a>).
			<br>
		</p>
		<b>ASE (All Seeing Eye) Support</b><br>
		<p>
			Scorched3D no longer supports server browsing via the ASE (all seeing eye) 
			server browser. This change was required to give us complete open source and 
			cross platform compliance. We would like to thank the ASE team for all the 
			support and the free use of their great product. It was much appreciated and 
			Scorched3D would not have had online play without them.
