<b>Equipment List</b><br>
<p>
The current equipment list is grouped into two categories: weapons and
accessories.  These are the same categories which appear on the buying
screen.
The name of the item is the name which you will see on the screen.  The
cost is given in dollars per bundle, e.g. $400 for a bundle size of 10
means that you get 10 items for $400 ($40 each, but you have to buy in
multiples of 10).  For weapons, a blast radius is given, which is an
estimate of how large the area of damage for that particular weapon is
(this can be effected by the current weapons scale being used).  The 
arms level shows the different strength categories of the weapons.<br>
<br>
Each category has a table describing the available items, and then lists
descriptions of the items and how to use them, along with pictures of the
icons which help you recognize the items.

<b>Standard Weapons</b><br><p>
The standard weapons are straightforward destructive devices.  You launch
them and they cause damage.  How much simpler can it get?
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Baby Missile</td><td>The Baby Missile is the earliest developed weapon,
                    and performs as such.  Every player has an
                    UNLIMITED supply of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Missile</td><td>The Missile is an enhancement of the baby missile,
                    increasing both the blast radius and the damage delivered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Baby Nuke</td><td>The Baby Nuke is a nuclear explosive capable of
                    destroying a large region</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nuke</td><td>The Nuke is a large-scale nuclear weapons capable
                    of mass destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leapfrog</td><td>The Leapfrog has three warheads which launch one
                    after another.  This is often very effective for
                    penetrating shields.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Funky Bomb</td><td>          The Funky Bomb explodes in a multi-colored toxic
                    chain reaction.  Sometimes they don't explode
                    exactly where you want them to, but they are
                    generally confined to the area where they hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MIRV</td><td>The MIRV contains five Missile warheads, which
                    split apart when the original missile reaches
                    apogee.  If the warhead hits something before
                    reaching apogee, it will not explode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Death's Head</td><td>The Death's Head is the most destructive weapon
                    created to date.  Functionally equivalent to
                    MIRVs, it contains nine large scale explosive warheads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Napalm</td><td>Napalm splashes around wherever it hits and then
                    bursts into hot flame.  It creates more heat (and
                    is thus more destructive!) if it forms deep pools.
                    If Napalm tunnels into the dirt, it may not get a
                    chance to spread out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hot Napalm</td><td>Hot Napalm is a deadly form of Napalm... much
                    hotter and more powerful.  Otherwise, it functions
                    pretty much like Napalm.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tracers</td><td>Tracers have no destructive capability, but are
                    useful for targeting someone without causing
                    unwanted damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Smoke Tracers</td><td>Smoke Tracers function as Tracers, except they
                    leave a brilliantly colored smoke trail behind
                    them.  This makes targeting even easier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Baby Rollers</td><td>Baby Rollers are the smallest of the roller
                    family.  When they hit ground, they roll downhill
                    until reaching a valley or a tank.  They then
                    explode with the force of a baby missile.  If a
                    roller hits a shield, it will just roll off!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rollers</td><td>Rollers are functionally the same as baby rollers,
                    but contain a warhead equivalent to a standard missile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heavy Rollers</td><td>Heavy Rollers are non-nuclear, but deliver a
                    payload more explosive than a baby nuke.</td></tr>

<b>Earth Destroying Weapons</b><br><p>
Earth destroying weapons are weapons which cause large (or small) amounts
of dirt to be destroyed.  Most of these weapons cannot directly harm a
tank, though they can cause them to fall and take damage that way.  Earth
destroying weapons are also good for removing mountains that are in your
way, or even removing dirt beneath yourself so that your tank is
repositioned (perhaps away from an enemy tank!)
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr><td>Riot Bombs</td><td>Riot Bombs destroy a spherical section of dirt
                    wherever the detonate.  They do no damage to
                    tanks.  Unlike Riot Charges and Riot Blasts, the
                    Riot Bomb is a projectile weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heavy Riot Bombs</td><td>Heavy Riot Bombs are scaled up versions of Riot Bombs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Baby Diggers</td><td>Baby Diggers are useful for removing small amounts
                    of dirt.  They tunnel when they hit ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Diggers</td><td>Diggers are more powerful versions of Baby Diggers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heavy Diggers</td><td>Heavy Diggers are the largest Digger-weapon
                    available, but often fail to reach their full potential.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Baby Sandhogs</td><td>Baby Sandhogs employ an alternate technology to
                    achieve an effect similar to the Diggers.  In
                    addition, each tunneling warhead contains a small
                    but powerful charge, which can destroy an enemy
                    tank from beneath.  Sandhogs are often useful for
                    burrowing beneath enemy shields, and attacking an
                    enemy tank directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sandhogs</td><td>Sandhogs contain more warheads than the Baby Sandhogs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heavy Sandhogs</td><td>Heavy Sandhogs can potentially destroy the world,
                    and should be used with caution...</td></tr>

<b>Earth Producing Weapons</b><br><p>
The category of Earth Producing Weapons includes weapons which take some
form of compacted earth that explodes into a much larger amount of dirt.
These weapons can be used to build fortifications, or bury enemy tanks.
There are other clever uses which can also be discovered... be creative!
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Dirt Clods</td><td>Dirt Clods are small warheads which explode into a
                    sphere of dirt when hitting something.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dirt Balls</td><td>Dirt Balls are a larger form of Dirt Clods.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Ton</td><td>A Ton of Dirt is a very large Dirt Ball, easily
                    capable of burying someone alive.</td></tr>

<b>Defense Systems</b><br><p>
The Defense Systems are ways to keep your tank alive longer.  They include
mechanisms both to prevent and to repair damage to your tank.  The wise
users of defense system will find their tanks lasting much longer than
unprotected tanks.<br>
<br>
Your own shields will never protect you from your own shots, though they
will protect you from secondary damage caused by your own shots (e.g. heat
damage from Napalm).  This means if your shields are enabled and you shoot
straight up (with no wind), then your missile will fall straight down, and
hit and destroy your tank.  Not only does this mean you're out for the
round, but you will also lose points for this!  And points mean money...
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Parachutes</td><td>Parachutes are useful as a means of preventing
                    damage when falling.  Parachutes work as follows:
                    If you are going to fall and your parachutes are on
			  (enabled) the parachutes will activate, and your tank takes no
                    damage from the fall.  If your parachutes are off
			then you will fall without parachutes,
                    and take damage.  You can choose whether the
                    parachute is enabled or off by using the 
				player dialog (described <a href="screen.html">here</a>).   
			By default, parachutes are off.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Batteries</td><td>Batteries can be used as an energy source for
                    recharging your tank.
                    When using a battery to recharge your tank, each
                    battery is equivalent to 10% of your energy, or 10
                    points.  You use batteries to recharge your tank
                    by using the player dialog (described <a href="screen.html">here</a>).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mag Deflectors</td><td>Mag Deflectors are simple shields which reflect 
			projectiles that are directly over
                    your tank.  Mag
                    Deflectors cannot absorb very many shots before
                    being destroyed.
 			To enable or disable any shield use the player dialog 
				(described <a href="screen.html">here</a>).</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Shields</td><td>Shields protect your tank by absorbing damage from
                    explosions.  In addition, a weapon which hits a
                    shield directly will not explode, though it will
                    damage the shield slightly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Force Shields</td><td>Force Shields deflect projectiles away from you,
                    and are generally capable of sustaining more
                    damage than normal shields.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Heavy Shields</td><td>Heavy Shields are immune to the shield failures
                    which often plague lesser shields.  They are also
                    capable of sustaining tremendous amounts of damage.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Super Mags</td><td>Super Mags are the best shields of all - stronger
                    than heavy shields, with the
                    side effects of Mag Deflectors.  If you can afford
                    them, youll be mighty tough to beat!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Auto Defense</td><td>Auto Defense allows you to enable any defense
                    system of your tank each round before combat
                    begins.  Once bought the auto defense gives you this 
			capability for the rest of the game.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Fuel Tanks</td><td>Fuel Tanks allow you to move your tank.  
				Each fuel tank will give
                    you 10 units of fuel.  Each unit of fuel will let
                    you move 1 square.
                    To use fuel, choose fuel from the player dialog 
			(described <a href="screen.html">here</a>).</td></tr>
