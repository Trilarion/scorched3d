		<b><a href="index.html">Introduction</a> -> Aiming</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>HUD</b><br>
		<p><img src="screenshots/aiming.gif"></p>
		<p>
			For the player whos current turn it is a current player indicator is displayed <img src="numbers/number-2.gif">. 
			This indicator shows through the landscape and can be used to locate the 
			current tank even if it is hidden from view by the landscape. The current 
			player is also shown on the plan view dialog as a flashing dot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aiming information for the tank is displayed as a red aiming triangle <img src="numbers/number-1.gif">
			that extends out of the front of the tank. This aiming triangle is aligned to 
			the current horizontal rotation and vertical elevation of the tanks gun. The 
			next shot will follow the path of the top of the triangle until affected by 
			gravity, the landscape or the wind. The triangle makes the direction of the gun 
			easier to see from a long distance, however for the best view of the gun it may 
			be necerssary to move the camera. See <a href="camera.html">here</a> for a more 
			detailed look at the on camera movement.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Next to the tank a HUD is displayed <img src="numbers/number-3.gif">. This HUD 
			is only displayed when changes are made to the tanks aiming direction.
			<ul>
				The HUD shows the following information :-
				<li>
					The horizontal rotation of your next shot in degrees (displayed as rot).<br>
				<li>
					The vertical elevation of your next shot in degrees (displayed as ele).<br>
				<li>
					The next shots power setting (displayed as pwr).
					<br>
				<li>
					The weapon used for the next shot (displayed as weapon).
					<br>
			</ul>
			The aiming information displayed on the HUD is also displayed on the weapon 
			display. See <a href="screen.html">here</a> for a more detailed look at the on 
			screen displays.<br>
		</p>
		<b>Keyboard Aiming</b><br>
		<p>
			The actual aiming of the tank is performed using the arrow/cursor keys on the 
			keyboard (not the keypad). The horizontal rotation can be altered by using the 
			left and right arrow keys. The vertical elevation can be altered by using the 
			up and down arrow keys. The shot power can be altered by using the "+" and "-" 
			keys. The current weapon can be altered by using the tab key. Fine adjustments 
			can be made to the aiming by holding down the shift key with any other key.<br>
			If at any point you want to revert back to the rotation, elevation and power 
			used for the last shot press the U key. Settings used for any previously made 
			shots can be viewed by clicking on the power icon on the weapons dialog.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once satisfied with the direction the tank is aiming you can fire the shot by 
			pressing the space key. All shots are affected by both gravity and wind. Both 
			of these factors need to be taken into account when lining up each shot.<br>
			See <a href="keys.html">here</a> for a full list of the Scorched3D keys.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<b>Auto Aiming</b><br>
		<p>
			As well as using the keyboard to aim you can use the auto aiming feature. This 
			feature allows the user to aim the tank at any point on the landscape. However 
			only the tanks horizontal rotation is aimed at the point, both the power and 
			vertical elevation must still be performed manually.
		</p>
		<p>
			To auto aim, point the mouse pointer at the position on the lanscape at which 
			you wish the tank to aim. Then press the "a" key on the keyboard (do not click 
			any mouse button). The tank should now rotate to point at this position on the 
			lanscape. The position on the landscape is also marked by a yellow stick.
		</p>
		<b>Tank Indicators</b><br>
		<p><img src="screenshots/indicators.gif"></p>
		<p>
			Above every tank is the player name <img src="numbers/number-1.gif">, color <img src="numbers/number-2.gif">
			and indicators for health <img src="numbers/number-4.gif"> and shield energy <img src="numbers/number-3.gif">.<br>
			The player name indicator shows the name of the player that controls this tank.<br>
			The color indicator is colored the same color as the player that controls this 
			tank.<br>
			The health and shield indicators display the amount of health or shield this 
			player has left.<br>
			<ul>
				The shield and health indicators use colored bars to represent health :-
				<li>
				All Black - This tank is not using a shield.
				<li>
				All Green - This tank has full shield energy or health.
				<li>
				Green/Red - This tank has been hurt. The percentage of green left is the health 
				or energy level.
			</ul>
			All of the indicators can be toggled on and off by pressing the i key multiple 
			times.
		</p>
		<p><img src="screenshots/tooltip1.gif"></p>
		A tooltip containing this information <img src="numbers/number-4.gif"> will 
		also be shown if the mouse pointer is moved over any tank, or over a dot on the 
		plan view dialog. This can be used if the camera is too far from a tank to be 
		able to read the other indicators clearly.<br>
