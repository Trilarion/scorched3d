		<br>
		<b>Camera Introduction</b><br>
		<p>
			Scorched3D is a game set in a 3D environment. To be able to aim correctly the 
			camera view will need to be manipulated to give the best view of the target. 
			Scorched3D has serveral different methods for moving and selecting different 
			camera angles. Each method is discussed below.
		</p>
		<b>Camera Presets</b><br>
		<p>
			One of the easiest ways of moving the camera is to use the set of pre-defined 
			camera angles (or presets) built into Scorched3D. A camera preset is a camera 
			angle that can be quickly selected by pressing a key on the keyboard. Each 
			camera preset presents the user with a different view of the landscape or 
			current player. Once selected the camera preset will keep the camera locked to 
			its view until another preset is chosen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each preset is useful for a different task. For example the tank views can be 
			used for aiming, while the action and shot views can be used to determine where 
			any fired shots actualy finished up.

		<b>Camera Mouse Control</b><br>
		<p>
			Although the preset camera angles are easy and quick to select, sometimes finer 
			grained control of the camera angle is required. For this situation the mouse 
			can be used to move the camera and tweek any of preset angles. The basic camera 
			mouse controls are listed below. The camera is prevented from entering 
			landscape but this can be disabled by holding down the left alt key.
		</p>
		<p>
			<table border="1">
				<tr>
					<td><b>Mouse Action</b></td>
					<td><b>Result</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Left Clicking On Landscape</td>
					<td>Moves the camera to look at the point on the lanscape where the mouse button 
						was clicked.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Left Clicking On Plan View Dialog</td>
					<td>Moves the camera to look at the point on the lanscape where the mouse button 
						was clicked.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Right Draging On Landscape</td>
					<td>Rotates the current camera view up, down and left, right.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Middle Draging On Landscape</td>
					<td>Zooms the camera view in and out.<br>
						For mice that dont have a middle mouse button, holding down both the left and 
						right buttons at the same time emulates the third button.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Scroll Wheel</td>
					<td>Zooms the camera view in and out.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>
		<b>Camera Scrolling</b><br>
		<p>
			The camera can also be panned left and right and up and down. To pan the camera 
			to the left simply move the mouse pointer to the far left of the screen. To pan 
			the camera to the right move the mouse pointer to the far right of the screen 
			and so on.<br>
			Holding down the left shift button during this process will rotate the camera 
			rather than panning it.
		</p>
		<b>Moving the Camera Using the Keypad</b><br>
		<p>
			The camera can also be controled via the keyboard. All of the functions 
			available via the mouse are available via the keyboard.
		</p>
		<p>
			<table border="1">
				<tr>
					<td><b>Keyboard Key</b></td>
					<td><b>Result</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keypad Left</td>
					<td>Rotates the camera left around the current viewpoint.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keypad Right</td>
					<td>Rotates the camera right around the current viewpoint.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keypad Up</td>
					<td>Rotates the camera up around the current viewpoint.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keypad Down</td>
					<td>Rotates the camera down around the current viewpoint.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keypad PageUp</td>
					<td>Zooms the camera in.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keypad PageOut</td>
					<td>Zooms the camera out.</td>
				</tr>

		<b>Camera window</b><br>
		<p>
			To prevent the user from having to constantly change the camera angle a window 
			containing a second camera angle can be displayed. To bring up the camera 
			window press the "c" key. The second camera window is always fixed to the shot 
			view and shows both the view from behind the current tank and where its shots 
			land.
