<b>Player Options Dialog</b><br>
<p>
Once you have chosen to start a game from the main menu, you will be allowed to
choose settings unique to each player.  All of these choices can be changed
while playing the game by using the player/team menu (accessed by pressing the M key).<br>
For each player starting the game the Player Dialog will appear.  This dialog displays the 
current players name and tank, 
and gives access to all the player settings you can control. <br>
Once you have finished making changes to each player click on the Ok button 
<img src=numbers/number-6.jpg> to continue to the next player.
</p>

<b>Entering Your Name</b><br>
<p>
For each player, you can enter a name.  You do this by typing the name via the keyboard.  
This name will appear at the top of the player dialog <img src=numbers/number-1.jpg>.  
Before doing this you may have to delete the existing default name by pressing the delete 
key several times.
</p>
<b>Tank Model Selection</b><br>
<p>
Whether you are choosing a human or a computer player, you can choose need the
model of tank that will be used in the game. For the most part, this is just a 
matter of taste.  Currently each tank model has exactly the same in game characteristics
regardless of their looks.  You can choose a new tank model by scrolling the tank selection
panel <img src=numbers/number-5.jpg> and left clicking on the desired model.<br>
The tank models are split into different catagories to make them easier to browse.
You can change the currently viewed catagory by changing the value in the drop down
list <img src=numbers/number-4.jpg>.<br>
If you don't want to choose a model, or want a surprise, choose the default model
(the question mark).  When choosing the question mark the computer will choose a
random model for you.
</p>
<b>Team Selection</b><br>
<p>
If your are starting/joining a team game then you will be able to choose a 
team using the team drop down box <img src=numbers/number-3.jpg>.
The team with the least players in it will be automatically selected, you
only need to change the setting if you are not happy with the team that has
been selected.<br>
If you are not joining a team game then you will not be able to choose a team and 
the drop down will show "none".
</p>
<b>Computer-Controlled Players/BOTS</b><br>
<p>
If you are playing a single player game (not a network or LAN game) you can choose 
to play against computer controlled players.  The computer controlled players
take the place of one or more human opponents.<br>
To change a human player into a computer controled player or vice-versa choose a player
type from the type drop down box <img src=numbers/number-2.jpg>.<br>
Each computer opponent has a different skill level, outlined below:-
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Human</td>
<td>A human controlled opponent (turns off any computer controller player).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Moron</td>
<td>Well, you can't get much stupider than this.  Morons just pick an angle and
power, and shoot.  Definitely for beginners only.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shooter</td>
<td>Shooters can be significantly deadlier than Morons, but they don't ever
learn, not refining subsiquent shots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tosser</td>
<td>Tossers start out like Shooters, but they'll refine their aim to get closer
and closer, until they hit.  If their initial shot isn't too close, you have
some time to kill them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chooser</td>
<td>Choosers are like Shooters, except they can also fire in straight line when close 
enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shark</td>
<td>Sharks are like Shooters, except they take grudges against players that are shooting
at them!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Random</td>
<td>Chooses a random computer opponent from any of the above.  You will not be able to
see which type has been chosen until the end of the game.</td></tr>
