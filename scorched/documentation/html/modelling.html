		<b>Scorched3D Modelling</b><br>
		<p>
			Scorched3D is exensible and allows new tank and missile models to be created. 
			Modelling for Scorched3D is currently supported using either 3D studio max or 
			milkshape. Milkshape is recommended as Scorched3D has better/fuller support for 
			this format.
		</p>
		<b>Milkshape</b><br>
		<p>
			The first step in making a model for scorched in milkshape is to actually make 
			the model in milkshape. A userguide to milkshape is a little beyond the scope 
			of this article, but are available at other places online.
			<br>
			<br>
			A note about textures at this point. Currently scorched3d only supports bitmap 
			(.bmp) textures.<br>
			These textures must also be square and have a resolution of a power of 2 (ie 
			16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024). Textures should be 
			kept in the same direcotry as the model (personally I like to place each 
			milkshape model and it's associated textures in a seperate directory). Also all 
			file names should be lowercase only, since scorched works on multiple file 
			systems and differeing file systems are case sensitive, the general rule of 
			thumb is to always keep filenames lowercase. Alpha textures are supported as 
			well, but must meet the above specifications. All objects in the model must be 
			textured, with the exception of the turretpivot and gunpivot objects (see 
			below).
			<br>
			<br>
			Once you've completed the model you should start naming the seperate 
			components. All objects that name starts with "gun" are considered part of the 
			gun (ie gunBarrel, gunSight, gunlength), and all objects that name starts with 
			turret are considered part of the turret (ie turretCenter, turretTop, 
			turretWing). The turret rotates around the Y axis along with the gun, to 
			indicate rotation, and the gun rotates vertically to represent the elevation of 
			the shot.
			<br>
			<br>

			Gunpivot
			<br>
			<br>
			Unless otherwise specified the gun and the turret rotate around the center of 
			the turret. If this isn't the desired behavior you can specify pivot points for 
			the gun and the turret. These pivots should be called "gunpivot" and 
			"turretpivot" repectively, these objects ARE NOT DRAWN and don't need to be 
			textured. All objects that start with "turret" are rotated around the center of 
			"turretpivot" object along with all objects that belong to the gun including 
			the gunpivot. All objects that start with "gun" are rotated around the 
			gunpivot.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once you've completed these steps export the model (File>Export>Milkshape 3D 
			ASCII...), then tranfer you tank model directory to the scorced3d/data/tanks 
			directory.
			<br>
			<br>
			Then open scorched/data/tanks.xml in a text editor (usually notepad) and place 
			an entry like this:
			<br>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>&lt;tank&gt;
	&lt;name>My Model&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;model type="MilkShape"&gt;mymodeldir/mymodel.txt&lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/tank&gt;</pre>
			</blockquote>All paths in the tanks.xml file are relative to 
			scorched/data/tanks so the above code assumes that your model is called mymodel 
			and it's in a mymodeldir directory. If you want to make a category for your own 
			models just place a category tag in the xml tag like this: <blockquote>
				<pre>
&lt;tank&gt;
	&lt;name&gt;My Model&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;catagory&gt;my category&lt;/catagory&gt;
	&lt;model type="MilkShape"&gt;mymodeldir/mymodel.txt&lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/tank&gt;</pre>
			</blockquote>That's all there is to making a tank in Scorched3d.
			<br>
			Note: If your tank's turret rotates down instead of up when increasing 
			elevation you may have created the tank backwards, if this is the case just 
			rotate the entire model around the Y axis by 180 degrees, and re-export the 
			file to the location specified in the tanks.xml file.
			<br>
			Node: Don't worry about the scale of your model, scorched automaticly scales 
			the models to fit inside the tank's bounding area... hence all tanks are 
			aproximately the same size.
			<br>
		</p>
		<b>3D Studio</b><br>
		<p>
			3D Studio Max is supported via its ASCII export option (.ase files). To 
			properly export the models they must NOT have any matterials applied to any 
			face, then use these settings :-
