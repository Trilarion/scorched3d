					<b>INTENDED AUDIENCE</b>
			</br>
			This document assumes you are already aware of how to control your tank, 
			manipulate the camera, and use the in game GUI. This document will instead try 
			to explain some of the finer points of the game so can understand how and why 
			certain things happen in the game. </p>
			<p>
				<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
		</br>
		Scorched Earth is an artillery game. For those unfamiliar with artillery style 
		games, the idea is to destroy all other tanks on the field without being 
		destroyed yourself. The winner of each round is the last tank left alive. The 
		overall winner is the tank that wins the most rounds over the period of the 
		game. </p>
		<p>
			This goal is accomplished by launching various weapons at your targets while 
			taking into account gravity, wind, terrain, and your opponent’s defences. You 
			are tasked with aiming your tank by determining the Power (distance), Elevation 
			(how steep a slope your shot is launched at), and a new element required by the 
			3-D nature of Scorched3D, Rotation (the adjustment left or right that your shot 
			will initially travel).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>TIME</b><br>
			Scorched3D games are made up of a certain number of rounds, which themselves 
			are made up of a number of turns.
		</p>
		<p>
			During each turn, players that are still alive get a chance to make a move. 
			Once all players have moved the results play out on the map and the next turn 
			will start.<br>
			<ul>
				When making a move players get the chance to either:
				<li>
				Shoot - Set your Power, Elevation, and Rotation, choose your weapon, activate 
				any accessories you want, and fire.
				<li>
				Resign – Stop playing this game and wait out until the next game.
				<li>
				Move - Activate any accessories you want, and move the tank to a new position 
				on the map.
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Each turn lasts roughly 40 seconds, depending on the server settings and how 
			soon you (and any others) complete all your adjustments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rounds are generally a maximum of 10 - 15 turns, depending on the server 
			settings, and may include a "Shopping" period at the beginning of the round 
			where you can buy weapons and accessories for use in the current round. This 
			period also gives the opportunity to sell unused weapons and accessories to 
			earn extra money.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rounds will end when either one or no tanks are left alive, or the turn limit 
			has been reached, regardless of how many tanks are alive. Dying in a round will 
			prevent you from playing until the next round starts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Games are a series of rounds in which kills and money accumulate, and end when 
			the set number of rounds has occurred. Once the round limit has been reached, a 
			winner is determined, and a new game begins with all totals reset to zero.
		</p>
		<p>
			<B>DEATH AND DYING</B><br>
			<u>Tank Deaths</u><br>
			When a tank is destroyed, it blows up in a random way. Players have no input on 
			the way their tank dies. The random death explosions include the Nuke, Baby 
			Nuke, Heavy Riot Bomb, Ton of Dirt, and Funky Bomb. This is the only way you 
			can witness a Funky Bomb in the first round of a game when there is no shopping 
			period. It is NOT someone cheating.
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally, the tanks are spread out enough on a map that death explosions pose 
			no threat to other tanks (except perhaps when the explosion is a funky bomb). 
			However if you are lucky enough to kill other tanks with the explosion of a 
			tank you killed, you will be credited with those kills and the corresponding 
			money awards. However, the explosion is random and you might find yourself the 
			target of your own kill. If you are killed by an explosion of a tank you 
			killed, you will be charged with a suicide and will loose money.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Self Kills: Suicides </u>
			<br>
			If you kill yourself, whether on purpose, by accident, or through means beyond 
			your control (i.e. your target died and dropped a Funky Bomb, which killed you 
			in turn), you will lose one kill from your total, even into the negatives. You 
			will also loose an amount of money equal to the amount awarded for killing a 
			tank with a health level identical to yours. Money will not go into the 
			negatives, but $0 is not good. A suicide will be tallied on your overall stats, 
			as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Team Kills </u>
			<br>
			In a team game, there is also the risk of killing team mates. Should the 
			unfortunate happen and you kill a team mate, by whatever means, you will be 
			charged with a Team Kill on your stats. Like with a suicide, you will have one 
			kill docked from your total and lose a sum of money equal to killing a tank 
			with identical health. Unlike a suicide, there is a chance you'll still be 
			alive to atone for your error.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>WEAPONS</b><br>
			All weapons need to be chosen before they are used. Only one weapon can be 
			chosen (or fired) at one time. All can be activated by both the menus and the 
			GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Shopping</u><br>
			Many servers do not allow shopping on the first round of a game. The only 
			weapon any player has available is the Baby Missile, which comes in unlimited 
			supply. Beacuse of the small damage effect, you have to accurately hit your 
			target to kill them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Weapons are bought in bundles, with anywhere from one to twenty individual 
			weapons per bundle. You need to be able to afford the entire bundle in order to 
			get any weapons of that type. Weapons can be sold individually for about 80% of 
			the individual value (bundle price divided by bundle size).
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally speaking, the more expensive a weapon is (bundle price divided by 
			bundle size), the more powerful it is, and thus, the more damage it does, to 
			both tanks and terrain. But, the more expensive a weapon is, the fewer of them 
			you will be able to purchase. A common course of action new players take is to 
			buy as many nukes as the can, generally about six. Sure, they want to be 
			certain that they kill their target, but it is more likely that they will miss, 
			particularly on their first shot, and then they've just wasted one warhead (of 
			their six) and several $.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you choose to purchase only a few large scale weapons, do not be surprised 
			to find yourself broke and out of ammo at the end of a round or two. At that 
			point, you'll be forced to use the infinite Baby Missiles, which limits your 
			scoring ability when others have more powerful weapons.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>MIRV weapons : Mirv, Spread Mirv, and Death Heads</u><br>
			These weapons split up into multiple warheads at the maximum peak of their 
			deployment. This split will happen only in midair and they will fail to split 
			or detonate if they hit the ground before they reach their peak.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Seeker class weapons: Diggers, Sandhogs, and Funky Bombs </u>
			<br>
			These weapons are multi-part weapons that split up on contact with the ground. 
			These particular weapons also seek out tanks in their secondary form, and are 
			thus more effective if you miss. Diggers and Sandhogs release mini-warheads 
			into the ground where they seek tanks from underground and come up under them. 
			Funky Bombs explode on contact with the ground and release several mini-bombs 
			into the air that seek out tanks while in flight. None of these weapons 
			guarantee a hit, they are only more likely to hit. And all of these weapons 
			expend their secondary warheads immediately upon contact with bedrock (the 
			bottom of the map).
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Hole-y Weapons: Riot Bombs, Riot Blasts and Diggers </u>
			<br>
			Most weapons create an explosion that damages both tanks and terrain. Hole-y 
			weapons however do no damage to tanks, they only destroy terrain. These weapons 
			are useful if you need to put a crater somewhere convenient. A good tactic for 
			these weapons is to target tanks with no parachutes, causing them to fall to 
			their deaths.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Gravity Weapons: Rollers and Napalm </u>
			<br>
			These weapons are affected by gravity once they contact the ground. Rollers are 
			multi-part weapons that release several rolling spheres when they touch the 
			ground. Each of these spheres then rolls downhill, exploding when they make 
			contact with a tank or when their fuse runs out (about 8 seconds). Napalm 
			ignites when it hits the ground, and then "flows" downhill, burning everything 
			in it's path. Napalm burns for a set period of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Tracers: Smoke and Regular </u>
			<br>
			Tracers have no effect on the environment other than to show you where your 
			shot will land. Regular tracers only show you the impact point of your current 
			aim settings. Smoke tracers show you the entire path of the weapon along its 
			flight. While everyone will see the tracer the round it is fired, only you will 
			see the marks in following turns. These are useful if you want to be sure a 
			shot clears every obstacle on the way to a target.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>ACCESSORIES </b>
			<br>
			All accessories need to be activated before they are used. Some can be 
			activated with keyboard shortcuts, and all can be activated by both the menus 
			and the GUI.
		</p>
		<u>Shopping </u>
		<br>
		Like weapons, most servers do not allow you to purchase accessories before the 
		first round. Accessories are bought in bundles, with anywhere from two to 
		twenty individual accessories per bundle. You need to be able to afford the 
		entire bundle in order to get any accessories of that type. Accessories can be 
		sold individually for about 80% of the individual value (bundle price divided 
		by bundle size). </p>
		<p>
			<u>Parachutes </u>
			<br>
			The single most important item in the game. Parachutes negate any and all 
			damage you would receive from falling. Most weapons have two parts, direct 
			damage from the blast, and a resulting crater. If the blast does not kill a 
			tank, the resulting fall into the crater usually will. Falling damage is the 
			leading cause of tank deaths. Help stop this by buying parachutes! Most newer 
			players do not want to spend the $10,000 on parachutes, preferring to get big 
			weapons, and are easy victims for the veteran players who use a single $150 
			Baby Digger to kill them, earning $6000 in the process. Don't give the vets an 
			easy kill. Buy parachutes!
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Batteries </u>
			<br>
			Probably the second most important item in the game, batteries are used to heal 
			your tank, at 10 hit points per battery. In addition to strengthening your tank 
			against further attack, batteries increase your available shot power, since 
			your shot power is directly related to your tank's health. Shot Power = Tank 
			health * 10
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Reflective Shields: Mag, Heavy Mag, and Force </u>
			<br>
			While all shields reduce the amount of damage taken from an explosion (shields 
			DO NOT negate fall damage), the Mag, Heavy Mag, and Force shields will actually 
			cause any shot that directly hits them to bounce off. This does use some of the 
			shield's energy (10 - 20 points), but generally prevents a close hit that could 
			do far more damage. Mag and Heavy Mag shields only protect the top of a tank, 
			like umbrellas with the Heavy Mag being a larger umbrella, while the Force 
			shield completely surrounds the tank.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Fuel </u>
			<br>
			Fuel is used to move your tank around the map. You can only shoot OR move your 
			tank in a given turn. Fuel is used form the GUI or the menu, and shows you an 
			area in which you can move with your current supply of fuel. The light area is 
			where you can move, the shaded area is beyond your mobility limit, either out 
			of range or too steep a slope. Double click in the lighted area to set your 
			move order.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>WIND </b>
			<br>
			Wind will affect your shot as long as your shot is in the air. Wind can blow in 
			any direction at one of six velocities ranging from zero (no wind) to five 
			(very strong wind). Depending on the direction you're shooting, wind may 
			increase or decrease the distance of your shot and almost certainly blow your 
			shot left or right of your intended direction. Plan your shots accordingly. 
			Wind will also affect rollers while they are on the ground (or underwater). 
			Fire some rollers at a flat piece of ground in any wind, and they will roll off 
			in the direction of the wind. You should also note that there is no air 
			friction in Scorched3D, so any weapon fired at a particular aim setting will 
			travel the same path as any other weapon fired at that same setting, whether it 
			is a tracer, nuke, or Death Head.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>WALLS </b>
			<br>
			There are three types of walls around the map in Scorched3D. Each type of wall 
			has a different effect on any shot that impacts with it. Each wall has a 
			different colored buoy associated with it for easy identification.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Concrete </u>
			<br>
			This type of wall stops all weapons that hit it. Any weapon that hits it 
			immediately detonates. This wall has grey buoys.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Bounce </u>
			<br>
			This type of wall will cause any shot to bounce off it like a mirror. A shot 
			then continues in its new direction until it impacts the ground. This wall has 
			blue buoys.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Warp or Pass-Through </u>
			<br>
			This type of wall teleports shots to the opposite side wall of the map with no 
			changes to its angle or power. Handy in high wind rounds when you cannot reach 
			other tanks by a direct line. AUTO AIM DOES NOT WORK THROUGH THESE WALLS. Your 
			tank will line up in a direct line to the spot you designate, NOT line up 
			through the wall, even if it is closer that way. This wall has yellow buoys.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>MONEY </b>
			<br>
			There are four ways of earning money, winning a round, wounding a tank, killing 
			a tank, and interest. Wounding a tank gives you money based on how much damage 
			you do in hit points. Killing a tank gives you money for damage in hit points 
			plus a "kill bonus". Killing a tank with one source of damage is worth more 
			than killing it with several sources (i.e. direct explosion OR a fall is worth 
			more than explosion AND a fall). Tanks in perfect health are worth more than 
			damaged ones, and you do get money for the hit points added when a player uses 
			batteries. The weapon used is factored into the money awarded so that more 
			powerful weapons give less money. No money is awarded for damage to shields.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Winning a round</u><br>
			Winning a round awards the most amount of money. It also gives the winner(s) a 
			round point, this point is the single most important factor when figuring the 
			overall game winner.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Interest </u>
			<br>
			Like at a bank, you will earn interest on any money you have "stored". Interest 
			is computed and added at the end of every round, at the percentage set on the 
			server. Any money not spent during the shopping period of a round, plus all 
			money earned during the course of the round is tallied for interest at the end 
			of that round. This total is then available during the shopping period of the 
			next round. Interest is not earned on any weapons or accessories you currently 
			possess.
