Scorched3D can be played online either over the internet
or a LAN.  Server browsing is now integrated directly
into Scorched3D.  To play online:-

1) Start Scorched3D and choose "Internet/LAN"
2) Refresh the list of scorched servers using the refresh 
   buttons.
3) Click on the server to join
4) Click the join server button.

----------------------------------------------------------

To start a Scorched3D server:-
1) Start Scorched3D and choose "Server"
2) Choose all the game options
3) Start the server

NOTE: The Scorched3D server browsing code will try to
automatically determine the IP address of the server.
If the server is behind a NAT or web proxy this may fail.
In this case it may be necessary to specify the server IP
address in the box provided on the server settings page.

Server conectivity can be checked by going to the Scorched3D
homepage (http://www.scorched3d.co.uk) and choosing the 
servers page.

----------------------------------------------------------

The Scorched3D client uses the following ports:-
80 TCP - For server browsing (outgoing connections only).
27270 TCP - For game messages (outgoing connections only).
27271 UDP - For server browsing (outgoing connections only).

The Scorched3D server uses the following ports:-
80 TCP - For server browsing registration (outgoing connections only).
27270 TCP - For game messages (incoming connections only).
27271 UDP - For server browsing (incoming connections only).

To run a server ports 27270 TCP and 27271 UDP need to be accessible
externally.

----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Scorched3D no longer supports server browsing via the ASE 
(all seeing eye) server browser.  This change was required to 
give us complete open source and cross platform compliance.
We would like to thank the ASE team for all the support and the
free use of their great product.  It was much appreciated and
Scorched3D would not have had online play without them.
