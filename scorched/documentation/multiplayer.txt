or a LAN.

To connect to a server perform the following steps.
1) Obtain the IP address or name of the server.
2) Start Scorched3D.
3) Check the "join server" option and enter the server name or
   IP address in the space provided.
5) Choose OK and continue as usual.

----------------------------------------------------------

Scorched also supports server browsing via the ASE (all seeing
eye) server browser. This software can be downloaded and installed
from http://www.udpsoft.com/eye/.

This software makes connecting to Scorched servers much easier.
Once installed this software will allow you to see all games
currently being played on the internet or LAN.  You can connect to
a server by simply clicking on the server.

Before starting ASE you must start Scorched3D and save your
screen mode and settings using the "Save as Defaults" option
from the menu.

If ASE does not show Scorched3D as one of its available options
you must open its filters file and add the following lines.

Scorched3D
ServerType: NEW
RegKey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Scorched\Location
ExeName: Scorched.exe

Mutex: SV

2 if game ~!= "Scorched3D" remove

The default server port is 27270.
The deafult ASE port is the server port +123.
