Scorched 3D - http://www.scorched3d.co.uk

Overview
--------

Scorched3D supports multiple platforms : Win32, Linux and Solaris.
Each platform requires different libraries and compilers.  The
following sections outline a brief guide to compiling.

If any errors are encountered please see the FAQ and Forums at
http://www.scorched3d.co.uk


Windows (Win32)
---------------

Compilation of Scorched3D is supported on windows via the 
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET compiler :- 
 http://www.microsoft.com/visualc
and the free borland compiler :-
 http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html.

To compile using Visual Studio .NET compiler :- 
1) Load the scorched.sln file in the base directory.
2) Choose build from the build menu.  No extra libraries are required
as they are all bundled in the source distribution.

To compile using the borland compiler.
NOTE: The borland versions of the wxWindows, SDL, SDL_net and SDL_mixer 
libraries are required for compilation.
1) cd into the borland sub-directory.
2) Run the createMakefile.pl perl script (Note: Perl is required for this
step http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/download.htm).
3) Edit the generated makefile and make.cmd file to point to your installed
borland compiler.
4) Run the make.cmd file in the borland directory.

Linux
-----
Compiling requirements  : 

 * GNU tools (http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/)
    aclocal (GNU automake) 1.5		[aclocal --version]
    automake (GNU automake) 1.5		[automake --version]
    autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.57	[autoconf --version]
    GNU Make 3.80			[make --version]
    gcc version 2.95.3 			[g++ --version]

 * Simple Directmedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/)
    SDL 1.2.4
    SDL_mixer 1.2.4 			[sdl-config --version]     
    SDL_net 1.2.5
	
 * WX-windows (http://www.wxwindows.org)
    wx-windows				[wx-config --version]

 * OpenGL (http://www.opengl.org) 	[glxinfo | grep -i version]
    server glx version string: 1.3
    client glx version string: 1.3
    OpenGL version string: 1.4.0 
    glu version: 1.3

Make sure at least all these are properly installed.
Note that SDL and wx-win provide their own m4 files. So 
a proper installed sdl and wxwin should provide :
sdl.m4 and wxwin.m4 in the ac-dir :/usr/share/aclocal
[check with : aclocal --print-ac-dir]

Run the following commands to compile scorched :-

1) chmod +x autogen.sh
2) ./autogen.sh
3) make
4) make install (may need to be done as root)

Scorched3D will be installed in /usr/local/games/scorched3d.
The Scorched3D executable is called scorched3d and is located
directly in this directory.


Generic
-------

A generic makefile generator is available in the generic directory.  cd into the 
generic directory and run createMakefile.pl to generate the makefile.

This makefile is a "generic" simple makefile that can be edited to allow scorched
to be compiled on most systems.
