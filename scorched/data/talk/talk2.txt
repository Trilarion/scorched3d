You broke my heart...!
Is it something I said?
Ooof...
Thank you doctor, but it's too late...
Over my dead body !
You'll regret this...
Now I know why they call you Hitler...
One direct hit can ruin your whole day...
You had no right to do this...
Oh no, not again...
Oh, man, my nail is broken...!
Goodbye...
Help me!...
Firewell, cruel world...
I'll call my father!
I hate dying on empty stomach...
What's that burning smell...?
What time is it now...?
I bought this tank just a week ago...
Another day, another bomb...
I prefer wrestling...
I want my lawer...!
Why does everything happen to me...?
I think we have gone too far...
I've got a bad feeling about this...
I haven't wrote my will yet...
I should've listened to my mother...
My friends will never believe me...
What was that noise...?
Everybody dies...
Thank you sir, may I have another ?...
I've got this crazy habit of dying...
I forgive you...
What a crazy way to lose weight...
I see a bright light...
Mommy ? Is that you ?...
Ha-ha-ha! Very funny...
What are you looking at...?
You really hurt my feelings...
Mom ! I think I'll be late for dinner !...
Why ??...
And I thought I can't die...
You can kill the metal, but not the spirit...
I didn't want to live anyway...
Was that as close as I think it was ?...
Join the army, see the world they said...
Does it mean I won't watch my cartoons tonight...?
And I thought you liked me...
Watch,son,this is how I don't want you to play scorch...
I think this guy is a little crazy...
Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore...
What do you want to do, kill me?...
What a strange way to die!...
What a headake...!
The things people do to get some attention...
I am losing my mind...
Something tells me I'm in trouble...
It's unfair, I wasn't ready...
Do you enjoy this ?...
Are you happy now ?...
Hou many lifes do you think I have ?...
Tell me I'm dreaming...
This is the last thing I need...
Can we talk about this...?
Fucken defence! I want my money back...
Everything was so good until you came...
You will lose all your friends this way!...
This will change my whole life...
This is not good for my reputation...
....and what was the good news ?...
Where did it come from ?...
Give me a break !...
Hei ! "Rambo 2" is in the next room...
I need some fresh air...
Control yourself...!
Don't worry, in parallel universe I'm probably kicking your ass!
What are you trying to prove here...?
Find yourself another target..! I quit...
Fuck you...
I need a bodyguard...
I thought this umbrella would help...
Who turned off the lights..?
My salary can't cover these damages...
Children ! Don't try this at home...
These dyings weren't in my contract...
I need a rase for this high-risk job...
Now I understand the words you said before shooting...
Next time just ignore me...
Do we have an easy level in this game..?
I feel like a magnet for your bombs...
The stupidity of my player just kills me...
It will ruin my haircut...
From all the players I had to choose this one...
I think my career is over...
Boxing is less violent...
I don't deserve this humiliation...
I think I'll never get used to this...
Can I borrow from you some luck..?
You won't get away with this...
Compare to this, dentist seems like fun...
You have some kind of psychologycal problem...
I think I have a temperature...
You should ask my name BEFORE shooting...
These games get more cruel every year...
My player don't care about me! I think I'll cry...
I could swear I saw something...
Strange! The sky are clear,but it's raining...
Next time use an alarm clock to wake me up...
Can't you see the sign ''No explosions''?!...
Who spilled the tomato juice on the floor ?...
I just can't watch this...
Let me out of here!!...
I have no words to describe this...
If you were me...
They said SMOKING will kill me...
We'll return after short commercial break...
It's the last weapon commercial I take part in...
In America they do it under the narkoze, you know...
There are much easier ways to get sunburn...
It will be a very long night...
It can happen once in whole lifetime...
Are you thinking what I am thinking..?
I was just talking about you...
I need a very long vacation...
Wait, wait ! One after another, not all at once...
A cheese has less holes than I have now...
I don't have a life insurence...
It will take care of my sleeplessness...
It will help me to calm down...
Will I live doctor ? Will I ?...
My grandmother makes roast chicken just this way...
Let me guess....Missile?...Roller?...Nuke?...
If somebody looks for me,I'm in nearest hospital...
At home,I was using this kind of bomb to kill bugs...
It will make my life shorter for ten years at least...
There are much better ways to solve problems...
Where was my mistake?...
I need one of these to kill my math teacher...
I can swear I had more fingers a moment ago...
You just had to ask...
This way World War II started...
I hate bombs sended by air mail...
Bombs with brakes are too expensive for you?...
"Made in USA".Good staff...Where do you buy them?...
I don't care...
If you don't kill your enemy, he kills you...
What a dust! Don't you ever clean your bombs?...
This bomb has rust! I'm even surprised it exploded...
I'm only human,you know...
Tomorrow it will be in the newspapers...I'm famous!!
Send the letters to semetery 5, grave 2....
Bad timing, as usual...
Won't you feel lonely without me?...
There is a limit I can take...
Who gave you the driving license?...
I don't feel comfortable...
What's matter with you? Can't you recognize me?!...
Damn, they probably changed the password...it's me,Jonny!!...
Where is my shild when I need it?...
How didn't I think of this before?...
I have the right to keep silence....forever...
You made your point...
Somehow I don't think your "sorry" will help me...
Mamma mia!...
I can't beleive my eyes...!
Shall I understand that as "no" ?...
We were like brothers...
I liked your shootings except the last one...
I hope this bomb has no calories. I'm on diet...
Where is my happyend?...
I think I just got one-way ticket to hell...
You broke my gold tooth...
I think I'll be in the red book very soon...
I was just testing you...
To be or not to be? I guess I losed the first choice...
Soon I'll start receiving bombs by fax...
Do you agree for a draw?...no?...what a suprise...
They don't make shilds nowdays like they used to...
Can't we settle it over a game of chess?...
And whole this just for me? Oh, you really shouldn't...
Collecting bombs is a very dangerous hobby...
It was my turn to shoot...
It will break the ice between us...
You too, Brutus...
Don't wait for me...
I'll never trust you again...
We can still stay friends, can't we?...
I hate when you do this...
You aren't waiting for a "thank you", do you?...
I think I swallowed my gum...how could you?...
It will rase my blood pressure...
If I just kill the birds around my head...
You make me sick...
My hair is burning! I prefer the barber's...
With friends like these, who needs enemies...?
I don't like it, but it's free, so I'll take it...
Can I get fries with that...?
No, waiter, it's a mistake - I ordered a chicken...
Now what ?!...
This is rediculous...
It wasn't my fault!...
We still have one round left, don't we?...
My grandfather is brobably turning in his grave right now...
This I call killing two rabbits in one shot...
I'm innocent, why don't you believe me?...
My parents won't be proud of me...
I still have the right for the last phone call...
Can you remind me the reason we started fighting?...
Somebody paid you to kill me? Jim?...Ted?...Mike?...
I see no way out...I'm scared...
This is disgusting...
Playing lottery I had more chances to win...
You look like the terrorist I saw in the newspaper...
I just wanted the 20000 $ reward for your head...
I wonder what would superman do in this situation?...
Superman, help...!
This is not a good end, but it could be worse...
Look,my boy,if you won't learn,you'll end like this...
There is a place for people like you...
So I forgot the password, big deal...
This I call "The Big Bang"...
Does the word "life" mean anything to you?...
I was just trying to be polite...
Can't you understand humor ?!...
That was just a joke, joke I tell you!...
What was I thinking ?...
You won't get my vote, that's for sure...
There are some things I'll never understand...
Take it off me!!! Take it away!!!!
If it is fine with you, it's fine with me...
Are you sure about this ?...
I hope you know what are you doing...
I don't want to fight you, they forced me to do it...
Let's keep this in secret...
I got the message...
I didn't like this from the beginning...
I'm so mad at you I think I'll explode...
You scare me to death...
I don't want to take any part in this...
Thank you, I wish you the same...
I was during my life in much colder places...
Can we skip over the exploding part...?
I was just starting to enjoy this...
Couldn't you find less painful way to kill me...?
It's unfair, you were peeping...
You need much more than that to shut me up...
Try to talk to the psychiatrist...
I just knew it will happen...
I'll take this as a compliment...
It just like a dream come true...
I'm so hungry I can eat a Nuke!...
You missed me!...just kidding...
Son of a bitch...
I'm a deadman, like my father before me...!
What? Sorry,I can't hear you,too many explosions around...
Guns don't kill tanks, crazy tanks with guns kill tanks...
Come on!...I have just enough problems without you...
It's easy to keep "open mind" when your head explodes...
I thought we have an agreement between us...
...on the second thought,you can have it,if you want...
Sometimes I ask myself why I am doing this?...
I couldn't shoot better myself...
You convinced me...
I take back the words I said about your skills...
Baby nuke, my favorite...
I think I started to neglect my health recently...
What all the excitment about?...
Why I am always the last to know about my death?...
I was just following the instructions...
You better have a very good excuse for this!...
If I just reach this button...No, I won't make it...
Do I look to you like a garbage can ?...
This is bigger than me...
I just can't live with this...
I feel like Elvis...he is dead?...you got my point...
All I asked is to leave me alone...
You lose your self-control sometimes?! Tell me about it...
Where is the emergency exit here ?...
I begin losing my patience, blood and other things...
Because of this I prefer private clinics...
Look at the bright side...what bright side ?...
You take my breath away...
I would say I'll die, but I'm not that optimistic...
I would like to see you play with somebody your size...
This is better then nothing...
Can you just feel the nuke in the air...?
I could buy shild, but no,I just had to buy this safety belt...!
This is a question of life and death...
What a way to take my blood analisis...
You just envy me...
Doctor,is there another way to kill louses on my head?...
I'm going down...
This heavy roller was too heavy...
My neck is turned in not natural direction...
Rest in peace...no, rest in pieces...
Only one way to live, and so many ways to die...
I think I was fired...
Wait a moment, Grandma, can't you see I'm busy...?!
With this bomb you couldn't miss...
I'm thinking that I'm sinking...
I didn't know my arm can be bended in that direction...
It's amazing, this tank has an entrance and no exits...
Zorro!...Spiderman!...Robocop!...police!...somebody...
I think I found one of your bombs, come to take it...
Stop with your dirty tricks...!
This bomb flies against the basic rules of phisics...
This is a murder, you know...
Wait a moment, I'm not dressed...
I couldn't stand in your tempo...
I must escape!!...Who put a glue on my chair..?!
Where is the fuel ? No, the puddle over there can't be...
Who locked the door...?!
How was I suppose to know this tank has no windows...?
I wanted to say something, but it escaped with my head...
No, microsoft, I take it back, I like your "Windows"...
I am dying, or is it just something I ate ?...
Earthquake! Grandma stop jumping! It's just the bomb??...
This will make you so WANTED...
You want to kill me, go to the end of the line...
You are not my first murderer, and not the last one...
Scoundrel !...jumping on a poor weak tank....
Come on, woodface, ruin my day...!
I always dreamed to look on the world from above...
This is not the way I planned...
I hate surprises...
Look at me now, Mom !...
Put the camera down!...you, reporters will never learn...
I changed my mind, you hear me?! I can low the price...
I changed my mind, take it for free, I don't care...!
Want to buy my left hand...?...my right hand...?...
I just can't find myself, you know what I mean...
The white flag was too small for you to notice...?
This bomb is too bomby...
It will always be some pieces they won't find...
It is too bad for even a nightmare...
Who gave you my address ?...
Waiter, the bill, please! I'm leaving...
Mne-e-e...What's up, doc ?...Hunting season started ?...
I was waiting for you to make the first move...
The commercial was so fancy, said something about heaven...
I can't afford big explosion, gimme something small...
This is hell of a bomb...
Just let me know when it ends...
I'm impressed...
Impressive...very impressive...
If you ask me, Terminator does these things better...
Superman, help !!...strange, it worked in the movie...
I'm not going to perform "dying swan" dance...
No, I'm not tax inspector, I'm just a postman...
Stay on Earth, sucker, I'm going up !...
I think you are sending me too far...
There is some mistake here, I ordered a chicken...
Read my lips:... He-e-e-elp !!...
I just wanted to light the sigarette...
When I was a child Mom said me not to play with fire...
May I take my "Playboy"s with me...?
I think it is a perfect time to change my tactics...
It has become suddenly too quiet, I don't like it...
I am sure I had less bombs in my tank a second ago...
That was really unnessesary, if you ask me...
You've got a very soft touch...
Keep your muzzle shut, you moron...!
I thought we have an agreement between us...!
From now on I'm on strike !....
For the coming month I'm closed for reparings...
I just wanted to watch the battle, I may got too close...
It will decrease my self- security...
Oh no !!...not into my ammunition box !!...
Pray for me...
In one circle of life I had three circles of death...
For your curved muzzle it was a very straight shot...
It was straight to the point...
I want to show you my famous disappearance trick...
You are fired...!
Your bomb passed the speed limit...
This was a good one...
Come on, I want to see you do this again...!
What a day...
Thank you for your collaboration...
You are killing me just because I'm your enemy...!?
It wasn't in the script...
I just wanted to kill you, that's all...
Look what the wind just brought in...?
God gives, God takes...
I guess Saddam became bored again...
How many times I told you not to play with that tank...
Hei, do I still have a time to give up ?...
What was that question again...?
Can I see the replay please...?
Don't push me !...give me my time...
Sorry, wrong address...
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time...
I feel myself superfluous...
S.O.S. !!!...
Let's compromise...
Don't put a salt on my wound...
Am I bleeding or am I bleeding ?...
Hei !...I played against the wind...!
Hei, not fair, I had sun in my eyes...!
I have a lot of high connections, you know...
Look what you have done !...
The sky is falling on me...!
Insolent...!
I read in the newspaper bombs are not harmful...
The bomb is like a wild untrained animal...
You're a monster!...
Don't just stand there, do something !!...
Watch out ! The tank is going to........shoot.
This was obvious...
Can I help you...?
Did you find what you were looking for...?
Don't look at me with these innocent eyes !...
If death penalty doesn't scare you, why should I ?...
It was you, wasn't it ?...
I thought you were just threatening...
I'm allergy to bombs...
I don't like this role, I want to play Romeo...
This is on your conscience...
What a shock...!
Do you have anything to say for your defence...?
All this is under your responcibility...
This isn't one of my yoga exercises...
I always had a mazohist character...
Any bonus...?
Don't you ever knock...?
Sadist...
Where are the applause...?
Come on, this is a final scene, give me some music...
Where are the titles...?
Don't look, you're embarrassing me...
I had to read the script before this scene...
I can't understand, the script ends here...
I wonder why they raised my salary before this scene...
You said it will be a comedy movie...
What a tragedy...
Where is the scene director...?
Oh, boy...!
Damn it...!
Oh, my dear Lord...!
I must behave normally...normally...the hell with it !
You discovered me...
Hei, driver, is this the final station ?...
What's next ?...I just can't wait to see...
This is my last blind date...
This was written in my horoscope...
Are you the guard...?
I don't like this way of " giving you a hand "....
" Keep in touch " mean sending letters, not bombs...
If you wanted to remind me of yourself you could call...
I'm your deptor...
I'll remember this for the rest of my life...
I didn't ask for an advance...
I will return this loan as fast as I'll able to...
This is hopeless...
You are kidding, right...?...right...?
Can I call you Mr. Hangman...?
What a tension...
I should have retreated...
I'm history...
My nerves can't handle this...
You still remember me ?...how sweet...
You are not making it easier for me, do you...?
Winning isn't everything...
I guess I'll stay here for a while...
Is this your first operation, doctor...?
This is just like the old times...
Cut !, cut !.....I hate this movie...
Now I got the prove...
I didn't know she is your wife...!
I shouldn't say " Come on, give me your best shot "...
Me and my stupid jokes...
This is not funny...
Now I know why women live longer than men...
So THIS way you solve the over-population problem...!
Come on, we can share this land between us...
I have a bomb-phobia...
Don't worry, I cloned myself...
When I what to sleep I start counting bombs..one..two...
Is this all you have in the menu...?
Chinese restaraunts...you never know what you'll get...
For a brief moment I thought I have a chance...
If you are not on my side, at least your bomb is...
It's good you decided for me, I hate making decisions...
I got some things to think about...
Are you suiciding me...?
You want me to leave? why didn't you say so?
You fight better, but I'm damn good in the dying part...
After you.........oh, well...
I thought you miss me...
You just couldn't miss the opportunity...
I turned my back for a moment, and you...
I knew you were doing something behind my back...
This explains everything...
What kind of surprise party is this...?!
We could make a very good team together...
My life will never be the same...
I don't want to end my life like this...
Come on, give me another chance...!
I guess I'll spend the rest of my life here...
If I stay alive, I promice I'll never smoke again...
I guess you're not the one who forgets...
Doctor, I don't feel my leg...
You said it won't hurt...
So you are the one who killed Robert, aren't you...?
After all I did for you...
Don't treat me like that, I can become offended...
This is deep inside of me...
The rest of my life will pass like a moment...
I'll feel pain till the end of my death...
This one really hurts...
My death will be longer than my life...
This is a very dramatic end...
I was never so dead in my life...!
I'm so close to death I can smell it...
You didn't have to demonstrate, I believe you...
Now I can say I saw everything in my life...
This is a painful experience...
I'll die even if it'll be the last thing I'll do...
The things people do to get experience...
I hate learning from my mistakes...
When they said vodka,I shouldn't ask for something stronger...
This is a bad start for a day...
I'm starting fighting at the wrong leg...
With such a morning, who needs an evening...?
I've got so many things on my mind lately...
I can't fight it anymore...
Look where you are shooting, you idiot...!
You'll end your life in jail...
You'll rott in jail for that!
You're really good at this...
This will affect me...
Where did you learn that...?
You are improving...
The last one was your best...
You're learning fast...
I've got this dying mood...
Suddenly I feel tired...
That's enough for me...
I have to rest...
I didn't know I have so many blood...
I kill for living.....what living...?
In my worst dreams I never...
Sorry, I have to go, the angels are waiting...
Bombs fly worse than birds, but fall better...
I hate gravity...
Look, there is a flock of bombs coming...
I'm leaving, you hear that...?!
Is it all you have to say for your defense...?
It's very hard to argue with you...
Do you have a permission for this...?
Who gave you the right to do that...?!
What are the charges...?
It's really hot at this season of the year...
Do you have a killing order...?
Keep your personal opinions to yourself...
You're over-reacting...
Come on, don't take it seriously...
Bad luck...
This is a torture...
Do you have any connection to the inkvizition...?
On what ground are you doing this...?
I think you skipped over the court stage...
What do you want from me...?
You have something on me, don't you...?
What will you get out of this...?
Whatever you boss paid you, I'll pay you twice...
I had everything, but I wanted more...
I hate people like you...
People like you are the problem of the humanuty...
You are the most unhuman kind of human...
This is unhuman...
I can't have half, I must have it all or nothing...
I took a chance...
This is not worth it...
How bombs can fly without wings...?
If it wouldn't be me, it could be funny...
I hadn't said my last word....now I did...
I'm jumping from hell to hell...
That was a very nasty thing to do...
How can you look in my eyes after this...?
If you have some problem, go to the manager...
I'm not buying in your shop anymore...
You can forget about birthday present...
I became thin lately, I look like sceleton...
I didn't know I have so many bones...
What part of my body is this...?
Monster !!!.....it just the mirrow...?
I can't watch myself in the mirrow anymore...
Who is that sceleton in the mirrow...?
Now I look pretty old for my age...
Something bothers me...
Can you show me the way out, please...?
I was so close...
Not me, him...!......moron...
Tell jokes we can both laugh at...!
What will you do next, blow up the world...?
The emergency number is 112...no, 441...no, damn it...
What a mess...
You are talking to me ?...
Are you hunting me...?
I told you million times, real tank is not a toy...
I didn't know that tank was loaded...
Son, I told you not to press the red button...
Just imagine yourself in my place...
We are back to the Stone age way of solving problems...
Lets talk like two civilizied people...
You're good in criticism...
I'm in a critical situation...
This is a pretty strong criticizing...
I hate this kind of active criticism...
Too bad you can take your word back, not the bomb...
What kind of language is that ?...War language...?!
Hold it !...hold it !...let me explain...
There is no limit how low you can get...
That was a kick under the belt...
I should agree for a draw...
You still want a draw...?
Hei, that's me, you friend Stinky...!
I should have predicted that...
This is so romantic...
This is bad...very bad...
This is getting worse...
What a lesson of anatomy...
When you said you fight for my heart, I didn't take it literally...
Waoo, I really can look through myself...
My heart is still beating...in my hand...
The things you can see inside your body...
I didn't know I'm so flexible...
I think that was my body a second ago...
Where is my left arm...?
I wouldn't believe it if I haven't seen it myself...
What part of the body is that...?
This part of the body is mine, and that one too...
Wooow, I see myself everywhere...
It really takes me apart...
I'm losing myself and I can't stop it...
I lost my appetite...
You caught me in the bathroom...
I guess I choosed the wrong time to disturb you...
Let's forget the whole thing...
If you want to scare me, you did it...
In moments like this I want to live more than ever...
This time you win, but only this time...!
If you want to laugh, this is the moment...
If you want to say it's a joke, this is the time...
Come on, return me these 2 bucks before I die...
Thank you, happy day to you too...
Stop with these stuff, I'm eating...
Sorry, I can't die right now, I'm busy...
I can't afford this...
I hope you waked me up for something important...
I guess you don't care about the change, do you...?
Thank you, I already have couple of these...
I'll never forgive myself...
I'm rich, I have put 50 bucks on you...!
I'm worried...
A dead got to do what a dead got to do...
Sure I'll die, what are friends for ?...
Damn kids...!
I'm very happy for you...
So far , so bad...
I didn't know it was yours...
You never change, always blame everything on me...
Your bomb is two minutes late and cold, next time I'll send it back...
Come here fast to see this, your bomb is getting cold...
Where have everybody gone...?
I thought you needed me...
Do you have an aspirin...?
Who is it?...Jack?...Bomb?? I don't know nobody named Bomb...
And I thought nothing can be worse than those potatoes...
I have to learn to keep my big mouth shut...
Me and my big mouth...
If that won`t kill me, I don`t know what will...
You waste your weapons, you could kill me with much smaller bomb...
I just tried to help you...
If not the wind, I would have won...
If I had enough money for a nuke...
I should have used nuke on you, when I had a chance...
I killed me only because I have let you do it...
Its not a big deal to win when you have more ammunition...
Its all because of you......I guess you know that...
If I had enough money for a good shild...
What could I do, you have thousands of shilds...
You won the battle, but not the war...
Its coming...big...nasty...scaring....a-a-a-a-a-a!....
Take it away  from me, please...please....plea...
Can you show me the way out?...No?... O`kay I`ll find by myself...
Excuse me sir, what is the way to the heaven?...
Hell ?? No, let me go to the heaven, please...please...
Are you sure it`s safe...? No??...but you said before...
And I thought they forgot my birthday...
I'm happy I caught it, it could hurt somebody...
I delete you from my will...
I thought you're on my side...
I'll die like a man.......Mo-o-o-ommy!!!!...
I'll die like a man...
Never mind, it`s the thought that counts...
With the life I had, I really lose nothing...
Comparing to the life I had, hell will be a good change...
Can I make the last wish?...No?....o'kay......
Does anybody know mouth to mouth?...
I deserve much better death...
I got it...
At this moments you learn to realy preciate things you had...
Now all my old problems look so small...
Producer, I've got the shot, I've got it...!...What camera?...
I had a good life...
Don`t cry about me, please...
I see burning tank!...Ooops, that's mine...
You never preciate the good things until you lose it...
I should learn not to start fights I can't win...
I'm look damn good in red...too bad it's my blood...
You are terrorist!...
