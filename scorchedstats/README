Once installed the imagecache directory must be writable by the webserver process.  This directory will be used to store avatars that are retrieved from the database.

The best way to do this is to use cron or some other system scheduler.

e.g. crontab line
0 7 * * * php <wwwroot>/stats/generateranks.php
